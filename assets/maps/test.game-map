Map file consists of size and space separated RLE encoded tile ID's

After which is a list of all tiles and their flags and layer IDs

There is no need to separate rows.

Example:
{Width} {Height} {multiplier} {tileID} {multiplier} {tileID} ....

Tiles start from 1 (0 is empty) and continue in order. Look at the tileset

(You can easily encode maps with helperScript/encodeMap.py)
